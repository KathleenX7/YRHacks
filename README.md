Type: Environmental simulation

## Inspiration

Our main source of inspiration was from one of our group member's pets, which are turtles and Earth Day. It led to further thought about the environment we live in and sustainability. Thus, leading to our idea of a stimulation, which we called "Save the Turtles".

## What it does

The main purpose of Save the Turtles is to provide users with a simulation "game" that allows them to recognize how their choices and actions affect the economy. Users are able to alter the settings of meat consumption, plant consumption, renewable energy use, energy efficiency, recycling percentage, purchase rate of new appliances, and transportation method. By changing these settings, users can see the impact of their actions on our natural environment, economy and citizens' happiness level.

## How we built it

It was built with socket.io, JavaScript, HTML and css and piskel.

## Challenges we ran into

Not being very familiar with CSS.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We've created a meaningful stimulation, with good UI and no Comic Sans.

## What we learned

We learned the importance of sleep, hopefully.

## What's next for Save the Turtles

We will be adding more factors and updating calculations in the future.
